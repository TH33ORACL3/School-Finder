## üîç How It Works

### Search Flow

1. **User enters location** (e.g., "Parklands", "Cape Town", "Blouberg")
2. **CSV Service checks** if location matches local area keywords
3. **If match found:**
   - Returns all 6 CSV schools sorted by distance
   - Shows "Verified Local Data" badge
   - Contact info and PDFs available immediately
4. **If no match:**
   - Falls back to Gemini AI for broader search
   - Uses AI-powered search with Google Maps integration
   - Works for any location in South Africa

### Data Freshness

- CSV data: October 25, 2025
- Fees: 2023-2025 (varies by school)
- 2 schools with actual fee PDFs
- 4 schools require contact for fees

## ‚ú® New Features

1. **Distance-based sorting** - Sort by "Nearest First"
2. **Verified local data indicator** - Green badge shows CSV data vs AI
3. **Clickable contact info** - Phone and email links in cards and modals
4. **PDF fee structures** - Direct links to downloaded fee PDFs
5. **Monthly tuition filters** - More relevant than annual for SA schools
6. **Distance badges** - Clear indication of proximity to Parklands
7. **Enhanced detail view** - Autism support, email, distance all visible

## üéØ Success Criteria - All Met! ‚úÖ
