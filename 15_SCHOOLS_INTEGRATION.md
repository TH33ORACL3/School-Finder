- **Search**: Still works with AI + CSV enrichment when user searches

### 2. **Fee Document Mapping** (`utils/csvParser.ts`)
Updated parser to map all 12 fee documents:

```typescript
// PDF Documents
- Shelanti_2025_Fee_Structure.pdf
- Blouberg_International_2023_Fees.pdf  
- KayDee_Special_Needs_2025_Fees.pdf

- Excelsior_Private_School_2025_Fees.txt
- Via_Nova_School_2025_Fees.txt
- Orion_College_2025_Fees.txt (Generic)
```

### 3. **Initial Data Loading** (`App.tsx`)
Added `useEffect` hook to load CSV schools on mount:

```typescript
useEffect(() => {
  const loadInitialSchools = async () => {
    try {
      const csvSchools = await loadCSVSchools();
      setSchools(csvSchools); // Display 15 schools immediately
    } catch (err) {
      setError('Failed to load schools. Please try searching.');
    } finally {
      setIsLoading(false);
    }
  };
  loadInitialSchools();
}, []);
```

### 4. **Public Assets**
All files copied to `/public/` for Vite serving:
- `schools_parklands_blouberg.csv` - 15-school database
- `fee-pdfs/` - 12 fee documents (PDFs + TXT)
