# CSV as Fee Database - Implementation Summary

## 🎯 Approach: AI Search + CSV Enrichment

The CSV database now functions as a **fee and contact enrichment layer** that augments AI search results rather than replacing them.

## How It Works

### 1. **AI Search (Always Runs)**
```
User searches: "Schools for ADHD in Parklands"
       ↓
Gemini AI searches with Google Maps integration
       ↓
Returns school results from anywhere in South Africa
```

### 2. **CSV Enrichment (Automatic)**
```
For each AI result:
       ↓
Check if school name matches CSV database (fuzzy matching)
       ↓
If match found: Merge CSV data into AI result
       ↓
CSV data overwrites AI data for: fees, email, phone, distance, PDFs
```

### 3. **Unified Results**
```
Display enriched schools with:
- AI-discovered school info
- CSV-verified fees (when available)
- CSV contact details
- PDF fee structures (when available)
```

## Key Features

### ✅ Fuzzy School Name Matching

The system intelligently matches school names even with variations:

```typescript
// These all match:
"Shelanti Private School" ← From AI
"Shelanti School"         ← From user search
"Shelanti"                ← Partial match

// Matching algorithm:
1. Exact match
2. Contains match (one name inside another)
3. Word overlap (>50% significant words match)
```

### ✅ Smart Data Merging

CSV data has **priority** for specific fields:

| Field | Priority | Notes |
|-------|----------|-------|
| `tuition_range` | **CSV** | Your manually collected fee data |
| `email` | **CSV** | Verified contact emails |
| `phone_number` | **CSV** | Verified phone numbers |
| `fee_pdf_url` | **CSV** | Links to downloaded PDFs |
| `distance_km` | **CSV** | Accurate distances from Parklands |
| `special_needs_programs` | AI | AI discovers programs |
| `brief_description` | AI | AI generates descriptions |
| `parent_testimonials` | AI | AI finds testimonials |

### ✅ Blank Fees Handling

**No more "Contact School" messages!**

When fees are blank in CSV:
- **School Card**: Shows "Fee info pending" (gray italic text)
- **Detail Modal**: Fee field is hidden completely
- **You can fill in later**: Just update the CSV file

Example CSV structure:
```csv
School Name,Tuition Fee Range (Annual)
Shelanti Private School,         ← Blank = pending
Blouberg International,"R52,478 per year (2025)"  ← Filled in
```

## CSV Database Structure

### Current Data (6 Schools)

| School | Distance | Fees | PDF | CSV Priority Fields |
|--------|----------|------|-----|-------------------|
| **Shelanti** | 0 km | *Pending* | ✅ Yes | email, phone, distance, PDF |
| **Kensio House** | 0.5 km | *Pending* | ❌ No | email, phone, distance |
| **Blouberg Int'l** | 1 km | R52,478/year | ✅ Yes | email, phone, distance, PDF |
| **Blaauwberg Rise** | 2 km | *Pending* | ❌ No | email, phone, distance |
| **Oakley Prep** | 15 km | *Pending* | ❌ No | email, phone, distance |
| **Oakley High** | 16 km | *Pending* | ❌ No | email, phone, distance |

### Adding Fee Data

Just edit the CSV file:

```csv
# Before (blank)
Shelanti Private School,,,

# After (filled in)
Shelanti Private School,"R120,000 per year (2025)",
```

The app will automatically pull this on next search!

## Benefits of This Approach

### 🚀 For Discovery
- ✅ AI search finds schools anywhere in South Africa
- ✅ Works for any search query (not limited to Parklands)
- ✅ Discovers new schools you don't have in CSV yet
- ✅ Google Maps integration for accurate locations

### 💰 For Fee Database
- ✅ CSV acts as your curated fee database
- ✅ Enriches AI results with verified data
- ✅ Gradually build up fee information
- ✅ No "Contact School" clutter - just blank until you fill it
- ✅ Easy to update - just edit CSV file

### 🎯 For User Experience
- ✅ Best of both worlds: AI discovery + verified data
- ✅ Works immediately even with partial CSV data
- ✅ Scales as you add more schools to CSV
- ✅ Transparent - users get both AI and verified info

## Example Search Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Parklands Search (CSV Enriched)

```
Search: "Schools for ADHD in Parklands"

AI finds:
1. Shelanti Private School
2. Kensio House Therapeutic Academy
3. Other schools in the area

CSV enrichment adds:
- Shelanti: email, phone, distance, PDF link, (fees pending)
- Kensio House: email, phone, distance, (fees pending)
- Others: Only AI data shown (not in CSV yet)
```

### Scenario 2: Johannesburg Search (AI Only)

```
Search: "Special needs schools in Johannesburg"

AI finds:
1. Various Johannesburg schools
2. Full AI-generated data

CSV enrichment:
- No matches in CSV (different area)
- Shows AI data only
- You can add these schools to CSV later
```

### Scenario 3: Specific School by Name

```
Search: "Shelanti School Cape Town"

AI finds:
1. Shelanti Private School

CSV enrichment adds:
- ✅ Email: vanessa@shelantiprivateschool.co.za
- ✅ Phone: 021 557 3484
- ✅ Distance: 0 km (In Parklands)
- ✅ PDF: Shelanti_2025_Fee_Structure.pdf
- ⏳ Fees: Pending (blank in CSV)
```

## Workflow for Building Fee Database

### Step 1: Search discovers schools
```bash
npm run dev
# Search for schools in any area
```

### Step 2: Note which schools need fees
- Look for "Fee info pending" on school cards
- Open school detail to verify contact info

### Step 3: Collect fee information
- Call schools directly
- Download fee PDFs from websites
- Save PDFs to `public/fee-pdfs/`

### Step 4: Update CSV
```csv
School Name,Tuition Fee Range (Annual),PDF Downloaded
Shelanti Private School,"R120,000 per year (2025)",Yes
```

### Step 5: Next search pulls new data
- No code changes needed
- CSV is loaded fresh each time
- Fees appear automatically

## Technical Implementation

### Enrichment Service (`csvDataService.ts`)

```typescript
// Core enrichment function
export const enrichSchoolWithCSVData = async (school: School): Promise<School> => {
  // 1. Find matching school in CSV by name
  const csvMatch = await findCSVSchoolByName(school.name);
  
  // 2. If no match, return AI data as-is
  if (!csvMatch) return school;
  
  // 3. Merge CSV data, prioritizing CSV for key fields
  return {
    ...school,  // Keep all AI data
    tuition_range: csvMatch.tuition_range || school.tuition_range,
    email: csvMatch.email || school.email,
    phone_number: csvMatch.phone_number || school.phone_number,
    fee_pdf_url: csvMatch.fee_pdf_url || school.fee_pdf_url,
    distance_km: csvMatch.distance_km ?? school.distance_km,
  };
};
```

### Search Flow (`App.tsx`)

```typescript
const handleSearch = async () => {
  // 1. Always run Gemini AI search
  const { schools: foundSchools } = await findSchools(prompt, locationQuery);
  
  // 2. Enrich with CSV data
  const enrichedSchools = await enrichSchoolsWithCSVData(foundSchools);
  
  // 3. Display enriched results
  setSchools(enrichedSchools);
};
```

### Blank Fee Handling (`SchoolCard.tsx`)

```typescript
// Show fee or "Fee info pending"
{school.tuition_range && school.tuition_range.trim() !== '' ? (
  <p className="text-lg font-bold">{school.tuition_range}</p>
) : (
  <p className="text-sm text-gray-400 italic">Fee info pending</p>
)}
```

```

## Maintenance

### Adding New Schools

1. **Let AI discover them first** (search in their area)
2. **Add to CSV with available data**:
   ```csv
   New School Name,Address,Phone,Email,...
   ```
3. **Leave fees blank initially**
4. **Fill in fees as you collect them**

### Updating Fees

1. **Open CSV file**
2. **Update tuition column**
3. **Save file**
4. **Done!** Next search uses new data

### Adding Fee PDFs

1. **Save PDF to** `public/fee-pdfs/SchoolName_Fees.pdf`
2. **Update CSV**: Set "PDF Downloaded" to "Yes"
3. **Update parser** to map school name to PDF file (if needed)

## Success Metrics

✅ **Build Status**: Successful (no TypeScript errors)  
✅ **CSV Loading**: 6 schools loaded and cached  
✅ **Enrichment**: Fuzzy matching working  
✅ **UI**: Blank fees handled gracefully  
✅ **Fees**: 1 school with fees (Blouberg Int'l: R52,478/year)  
✅ **PDFs**: 2 schools with downloadable PDFs  
✅ **Email/Phone**: All 6 schools have contact info  

## Future Enhancements

1. **Admin Panel**: Web UI to edit CSV data
2. **Fee Comparison**: Compare fees across schools
3. **Fee History**: Track fee changes over time
4. **Bulk Import**: Import fees from spreadsheets
5. **Fee Alerts**: Notify when new fees are available
